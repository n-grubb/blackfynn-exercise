# Filter Project

The goal of this project is to build a mobile-optimized user listing page that with the ability to filter the results based on typed input via a text field. This project can be built using any front-end framework and/or libraries of your choosing,
but be prepared to explain your choices.

The requirements are:

* Use the following endpoint to make a single network call to generate the user list:
  `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=100`

* Create a client-side filter (no additional server-side calls) to display matches comparing the end user's typed input against for the user directory's first and/or last names.

* Display the random list of users in a mobile-friendly design while maintaining 20px margins on all sides of the user info. Meta data to be displayed includes a thumbnail, first and last name, and street address.

* Display the total number of results in real-time as the user types.

* Any mismatches just return the full list in the original order.

* Post completed project to Github and send us back a link. Code should also include instructions on how to run the project. 

Please see the demo file for a quick video of how the project could look and how it should work.
